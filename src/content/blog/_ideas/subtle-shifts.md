About 5 years ago, on a summer trip, I felt like proving something to myself. The first thing that came to my mind was: "Why not just stop eating meat?" (I was in a DÃ¶ner place in Amsterdam at that time). I never really put much thought into it. Even after seeing the gruesome things happening in factory farming, climate impact, or potential health benefits, I just took these as fact and continued eating meat, no second thought given. But, funnily enough, at that moment, I just decided I needed to prove something to myself and maybe even selfishly use this to stand out from others.

In the beginning, I always prefaced 'coming out' as vegetarian (at that time) to others with something along the lines of "Oh, but I'm not that type of vegetarian, I don't want to push my morals on anyone else!". For me, it was more of a lifestyle choice. And that's not a bad reason! Go use this as something to (artificially) stand out! The hard part that often inevitably follows is not being too die-hard and being able to adapt your positions, something I see myself struggling with.

This post isn't about convincing anyone, so I'll skip all the stats. However, after transforming not eating animal products for the fun of it into something more science and morals-based, I find it impossible to be level-headed in discussing this topic. How do you talk about this to someone without highroading them? And even writing this, I don't want to feel any 'superiority' over others just because I care a lot about this issue, but I subconsciously do. Overly focusing on these "optics" can destroy your argument, but they can't be ignored for a personal issue that goes hand in hand with personal sacrifice.

Not that being vegan is hard - however it can be a big, personal change. Even though it might not seem that way, things like not being able to go out to many restaurants or even to travel to some countries without cooking for yourself every day can be very demoralizing. Especially when you try not to alienate friends and family, who often (weirdly enough) have firm opinions.

It's hard to talk about topics you're so passionate about without being "fake", humble, or condescending. Either you go too aggressive and create division or are too afraid to take risks and water down your position. Overly relying on "marketing tactics" to get your idea to fit somewhere in the middle can also destroy its effectiveness because you won't get any coverage without sensation.

One of my solutions for this is increasing "focus". Coming together for a single point, not trying to combine many ideas into a single, incomprehensible mess. Having few large campaigns that end up combining all kinds of ideas that no one really agrees with leads to the same issue we see in the political landscape, where change is hard to come by.

Another one is not 'educating' others. Getting someone to change their core principles is the hard part. You can easily find (good!) excuses to not care about the climate/animals/whatever since nobody on their own can make a difference, right? Change is scary.

I don't really have anything to tie this together, just some observations. Still figuring it out myself. :)
